# The Dojo way

The Dojo way - the principles you will need to follow to join the Dojo movement.

## What it is

The original meaning of the word dojo is a place to practice martial arts.

Here, though, we're expanding its meaning and what it stands for.

Be warned: the Dojo way is not necessarily an easy life choice. If you want an "easy" life, this might not be right for you.

## How to use this document

By reading through this document and adding your name at the end of this README, you will be *committing* to the Dojo way.

You're welcome to add Dojo to your name on social media, but it's not a required part of the initiation process.

There are rumors that you will need to drink blood of a unicorn, but I'm not sure where to find unicorns to be honest - maybe go to Sillicon Valley or Tel Aviv for that.
